The iris flower classification project is a machine learning project that aims to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica. The project uses a dataset of iris flower measurements, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The project overview is as follows:

Load the iris flower dataset.
Preprocess the data by cleaning and normalizing it.
Split the data into training and test sets.
Train a machine learning model on the training set.
Evaluate the model performance on the test set.
Deploy the model to production so that it can be used to classify new iris flowers.

It can be used to develop a model that can be used to classify iris flowers in the real world.
